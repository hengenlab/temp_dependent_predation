# Temperature-Dependent Predation Project

This repository contains all code associated with our study on temperature-dependent predation and vertebrate richness. It includes:

- Python scripts for video tracking and environmental sensor logging
- R and shell scripts for spatial modeling, experimental analysis, and figure generation

---

## Python Tools: Video & Sensor Processing

Python scripts process behavioral videos using DeepLabCut and log temperature/humidity from Raspberry Pi sensors.

See [README_Python.md](Python_code/README_Python.md) for full details on:

- Prey capture trial processing (DLC data)
- Solitary control behavior
- Pretrial behavior analysis
- Sensor setup and data logging scripts

---

## R + Shell Workflow: Spatial Modeling, Statistics, and Figures

R and shell scripts handle all major modeling and visualization steps:

- Species richness rasterization
- Spatial covariate extraction
- Spatial and experimental model fitting
- Generation of all figures in the manuscript

See [README_R.md](R_shell_code/README_R.md) for detailed script summaries and execution order.
